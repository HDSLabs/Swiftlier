SwiftPlusPlus
=============

Library for common enhancements to the Swift language developed by Apple

Goals
=====

I would love to have a common library of helpful extensions and classes that many
developers use. This would allow us to use more advanced features while maintaining
readability. I encourage you to submit pull requests or issues with additional features
that we can discuss to see if they should be added.
